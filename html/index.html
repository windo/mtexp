    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      You are about to take part of an experiment to help understand how
      we see things.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be shown an image for a very short time - less than a
      second. You will then be asked a question about the image. You will
      have to repeat this many times to collect data.
    </p>
    <h1>Experiment</h1>
    <p>
      In this experiment, the image is always made up of short red and
      blue lines. The <b>red</b> lines are <b>horizontal</b> and
      <b>blue</b> lines are <b>vertical</b>:<br> <img
      src="images/example_lines.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      In some images, there will also be a <b>red vertical</b> line:<br>
      <img src="images/example_red_vertical.png">
    </p>
    <p>
      The question you are asked after each image is whether there was a
      <b>red vertical</b> line. To answer the question, press:
      <ul>
        <li><b>1</b> - there was a <b>red vertical</b> line</li>
        <li><b>2</b> - no <b>red vertical</b> line</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p>
      Make sure your computer screen is clear and visible. For example,
      make sure sunlight or dust does not make the screen hard to see. If
      needed, adjust the brightness of the screen. Wear glasses if you
      need them to see well.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are shown images for a very short time and it may be hard to
      answer the question. This is OK! The experiment is hard so we could
      tell what people can see and what people can not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spend as much time as you need for the first few questions to learn
      how the experiment works. Later, you can speed up. Always try your
      best to give the correct answer!
    </p>
    <p>
      You should be able to tell the correct answer for some of the
      questions. If you can not tell the correct answer for any of first
      25 questions, stop the experiment. We will not be able to use the
      data when there are no correct answers. We have probably made a
      mistake in the experiment that makes it not work well on your
      computer.
    </p>
    <h1>Start the experiment</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="#" onclick="window.location='mtexp.html'+window.location.search;">Start the experiment</a>. The experiment will stop once you have collected 1000 data points. Expect to spend about 30 minutes on this.
    </p>

      Thank you for participating!
